# Web Scraping

The project aims to leverage the Puppeteer library for web scraping tasks. Puppeteer is a Node.js library that provides a high-level API over the Chrome DevTools Protocol, allowing for easy automation of web browser interactions, including navigation, form submission, and data extraction.


## Project Setup 

To deploy this project on the terminal, run

```bash 
  node scrapers.js
```
    
## Some Ideas Using Puppeteer for Web Scraping

* `News Aggregator:` Utilize Puppeteer to scrape headlines and article content from various news websites. Categorize the news articles and present them to users for easy access to current events.

* `Price Comparison Tool:` Scrape product prices from different e-commerce websites to create a tool that helps users find the best deals. Users can specify products they're interested in, and the tool presents the prices from various sources for comparison.

* `Real Estate Search Tool:` Use Puppeteer to gather real estate listings from property websites, allowing users to filter listings based on criteria such as location, price, and amenities.

* `Recipe Repository:` Scrape cooking recipes from food blogs and websites, categorize them, and provide users with a searchable database of recipes. Integration with ingredient lists can help users find recipes based on the ingredients they have on hand.

* `Social Media Analytics Tool:` Monitor social media platforms like Twitter or Instagram for specific hashtags or topics. Analyze trends and sentiment in real-time, providing users with insights into popular discussions and trends.

* `Film or Music Review Aggregator:` Scrape movie reviews or song lyrics from platforms like IMDb or Genius. Provide users with aggregated reviews and ratings to help them make decisions about what to watch or listen to.
